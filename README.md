# ðŸ“œ Description of the project

## Where does the project come from ...

For a class project I had to chose between a few projects and was already interested in graph theory at the time. 

## What the project does ...

Allows players to play a game of Node Kayles : the players are presented a graph and they take turn selecting a node in this graph. The node they selected and every nodes connected to this one are getting deleted. The first player not able to play, because the graph is empty, loses.

The project implements :

- A version of the game online and offline

- A database to store the graphs of the community and the user informations

To be implemented next :

- An AI to play against
